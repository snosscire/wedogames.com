An endless swarm of asteroids are heading for earth and will destroy all life as we
know it. You have been sent out into space to destroy these asteroids before they hit
earth.

Target and destroy asteroids by typing the words next to them. When the earth's
percentage has reached 0% the game is over. For each level the number of asteroids
and their speed is increased and on top of that the word you have to type to
destroy an asteroid gets longer.

Challenge your friends and see who is the faster typist!
