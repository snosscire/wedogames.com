Rouge lite/minesweeper mashup. The goal is to reach as low floor as possible.

You are a lonely warrior heading further and further down the dungeon.
It is pitch black so you can't see what horrors hide in the darkness.
Only by walking through the room, one step at the time, you will reveal numbers
that indicate how many monsters are nearby.

When you've uncovered all tiles with no monsters you've cleared the room and
the doors to other rooms or if you are lucky the stairs down to the next level
will reveal itself.

If you happen to step on a monster you have to fight it. Be careful though.
When you fight monsters you loose health. When you've lost all our health
the game is over.

Each time you fight a monster or clear a room you gain experience. Gain enough
experience and you gain a level and your health is replenished and you grow stronger.

Control player with arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`). Click on buttons with mouse.
You can use `enter` for some buttons.
