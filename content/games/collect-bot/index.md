Multiplayer runner. Play up to two players in split screen. One player controls its
character with the keyboard (`↓` and `space`) the other player controls its character
with the mouse buttons.

You play as a robot whose mission it is to collect as many coins as possible in 90 seconds.
The robot moves by itself and it is your job to avoid all obstacles by either jumping
(`space`) or ducking (`↓`). Once you've run the whole course you can either run again
to try and collect more coins or you can wait until the round ends to save the coins
you've collected. But remember if you die you lose all the coins you've collected.

Resolution can be adjusted in the `Game.ini` file.
